# General Provisions

`Version: 30 Jan 2023`

These Terms of the Managed OpenShift Service (elsewhere referred to as the Terms of Service, Terms) define the essence and composition of the "Managed OpenShift" Service (elsewhere referred to as the Service) â€” a set of technical subscription-based services continuously rendered by Stakater.

Stakater is entitled to amend the Terms of Service unilaterally by approving a new version of the Terms.

The new edition of the Terms of Service shall come into force on the thirtieth (30th) calendar day after the notice of amendment was sent to the Customer. The period from the date of Stakater's notification of changes to the Terms until the date on which the new version of the Terms takes effect is called the transition period.

Stakater shall send notice of amendment of the Terms to the email address specified in the Service Agreement. The Customer is responsible for familiarizing themselves with the new edition of the Terms of Service.

Refusal of the Customer to accept the new edition of the Terms and Conditions shall result in sending by the Customer to Stakater a notice of refusal to accept the new edition of the Terms during the transition period. The aforementioned notice shall be sent to the email address of Stakater specified in the Service Agreement.

Notification of the Customer's refusal to accept the new edition of the Terms shall simultaneously be deemed to be a notice of early termination of the Agreement in respect of the relevant Order at the Customer's initiative by the unilateral refusal of the Customer to fulfill it. The Contract shall terminate in respect to the relevant Order on the last day of the transition period unless the Parties agree on an earlier date.

Failure of the Customer to submit a refusal to accept the new edition of the Terms within the transition period and continued use of the Service by the Customer after the entry into force of the new edition of the Terms shall be deemed the Customer's acceptance of the new edition of the Terms in full.
